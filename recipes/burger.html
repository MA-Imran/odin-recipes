    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      If you showed up at a cookout where you heard they were making burgers,
      but once you got there you realized they were talking about chicken
      burgers, would you be excited or profoundly disappointed? That’s what I
      thought. Me too. When your mouth is ready for juicy and flavorful,
      something dry and bland just won’t do, which is why I was so thrilled with
      how these chimichurri chicken burgers turned out. They weren’t just
      comparable, but maybe even…better? Okay, that might be a stretch, but the
      fact that I was even having those thoughts is a great indication of just
      how much I enjoyed these.
    </p>
    <p>You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <h2>Chimichurri Sauce:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup Italian parsley leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chicken Burgers:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make chimichurri, chop herbs with a sharp knife until fine; add
        sliced garlic to the mixture. Continue chopping until mixture is very
        fine; transfer to a bowl. Stir in the 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine
        vinegar, the 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cumin, and red pepper
        flakes. Wrap and refrigerate until needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        To make burgers, place chicken thighs in the freezer until firm and
        half-frozen, about 30 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place thighs on a cutting board, and using a large sharp knife or heavy
        cleaver, chop until it resembles coarsely ground meat. (Alternatively,
        place chicken in a food processor; pulse on and off, scraping sides
        often, until texture resembles coarsely ground meat.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a bowl, add the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 cup
        chimichurri sauce. Use a fork to mix thoroughly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Using damp hands, form chicken mixture into 4 equal-sized patties, about
        1/2-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir together mayonnaise and remaining chimichurri sauce to make spread
        for buns; refrigerate until needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove burgers from the fridge; sprinkle both sides with breadcrumbs.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add olive oil to a large non-stick skillet and set over medium high
        heat. When hot, but before oil starts smoking, add burgers, and cook
        about 5 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through. An instant
        read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 to 150 degrees
        F (63 to 65 degrees C).
      </li>

      <li>
        Let burgers rest for a minute or two. Serve on buns spread with
        chimichurri mayo and the fixings of your choice.
