      <li>1 cup flaked coconut</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cream Cheese Frosting:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces cream cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons light cream</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>1 cup flaked coconut</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 9-inch
        round cake pans.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make the cake: Combine buttermilk and baking soda together in a small
        bowl; set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Beat butter, shortening, and sugar together in a large bowl with an
        electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs, buttermilk mixture,
        vanilla, coconut, baking powder, and flour; stir until just combined.
        Pour batter into the prepared pans.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of
        the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5
        minutes; transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, 20 to 25
        minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make the frosting (while cakes are cooling): Beat cream cheese, butter,
        vanilla, and confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl with an electric
        mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in cream, a little at a time, to
        attain the desired consistency. Stir in walnuts and coconut. Spread
        frosting between the cake layers and on the top and sides of cooled
        cake.
